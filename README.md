# Group Chat

#### Video demo: <https://youtu.be/yS5OEGl-2zA>

Hello, my name is Eduardo Lustosa from Brazil, and this is my CS50 final project. I'm presenting to you a real-time chat application that allows users to chat with each other in a global chat environment. To make this possible, I utilized a technology called WebSockets, enabling real-time data exchange between a client and a web server.

## Overview

This project is a real-time chat application that enables users to have conversations in a global chat room. I used technologies such as Flask and Flask-SocketIO on the server side and Socket.IO on the client side to make this possible.

## Key Features

- **Global Chat:** Users can join a global chat and send real-time messages to one another.
- **Message Persistence:** All messages are stored in the database, ensuring that conversations are not lost even after reloading the page.
- **Real-Time Message Flow:** Messages are sent to the server and broadcasted in real-time to all connected users.

## Running the Project

If you want to run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application with `python app.py`.
4. Open a web browser and access `http://localhost:5000` to use the real-time chat.
